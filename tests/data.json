[{"pageid": 2791120, "ns": 0, "title": "Jason Calacanis", "extract": "Jason McCabe Calacanis (born November 28, 1970) is an American Internet entrepreneur, angel investor, author and podcaster.His first company was part of the dot-com era in New York, and his second venture, Weblogs, Inc., a publishing company that he co-founded together with Brian Alvey, capitalized on the growth of blogs before being sold to AOL. In addition to being an angel investor in various technology startups, Calacanis also presents at industry conferences worldwide.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCalacanis was born in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York and has two brothers.He graduated from Xaverian High School in 1988. He then attended Fordham University, where he received a B.A. in psychology.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCalacanis started his career in the 1990s as a reporter covering the internet industry in New York.As a blogger, Calacanis co-founded the blog network Weblogs, Inc. with Brian Alvey. They founded Weblogs, Inc. in September 24, 2003, and the startup was supported by an angel investment from Mark Cuban. \nTwo years after inception, the Weblogs, Inc. blogs business was generating $1,000 a day just from AdSense. Time Warner's America Online agreed to buy Weblogs, Inc. in October 2005 for $25\u201330 million.Before forming Weblogs, Inc., Calacanis was founder and CEO of Rising Tide Studios, a media company that published print and online publications. During the dot-com boom, Calacanis was active in New York's Silicon Alley community, and in 1996 began producing the Silicon Alley Reporter. Originally a 16-page photocopied newsletter, it eventually expanded into a 300-page magazine, with a sister publication called the Digital Coast Reporter for the West Coast. Calacanis' socializing earned him a nickname as the \"yearbook editor\" of the Silicon Alley community. The company also organized conferences in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco focused on the Internet, web, and New Media. With the end of the Dot-com bubble, Silicon Alley Reporter failed, and the company was sold out of bankruptcy to a private equity firm.On November 16, 2006, TechCrunch reported that Calacanis had resigned from his position as CEO of Weblogs, Inc. and general manager of Netscape. Calacanis later confirmed this on his blog and the Gillmor Gang podcast.Calacanis joined Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm, as an EIA (entrepreneur in action) in December, 2006,a position which he held until May, 2007. Through this program, Calacanis invested $25K in Travis Kalanick's company, Uber. The deal is now worth about $100 million.He launched the web directory Mahalo (\"thank you\" in Hawaiian), which raised $20 million in venture capital from investors including Sequoia Capital, News Corp, CBS, Mark Cuban, and Elon Musk. The company hit a peak of 15 million unique visitors a month and achieved profitability in 2011, but suffered a sharp decline in traffic that year from the Google Panda search algorithm update and shut down in 2014.Calacanis founded ThisWeekIn.com, which shut down in 2012 but is live again and available as a weekly podcast.This Week in Startups (also called TWiSt) is a show hosted by Calacanis.He also founded a startup Inside.com which focuses on delivering thematic newsletters. The company raised $2.6 million.In June, 2019, Calacanis partnered with the NSW Government to create the Sydney Launch Festival for startups to give their pitches to global audiences.\n\n\n=== Angel investing ===\nIn 2009, Calacanis founded the Open Angel Forum, an event that connects early-stage startups with angel investors. The forum was the culmination of a series of public comments by Calacanis questioning the ethics of pay-to-pitch angel forums. Calacanis believes startups shouldn't have to pay to pitch angel investors, calling out fees that can range from $1,000 to $8,000 for a single 10- or 15-minute presentation. Calacanis is an angel investor in Robin Hood, wealthfront, Uber, desktop metal, datastax, thumbtack, superhuman and trello.Calacanis raised a $10 million fund for his own venture investment firm to invest in startups that emerged from the Launch conference. Limited partners in the fund include David Sacks.\nFollowing the success of the Launch conference, Calacanis declared his intent to get closer and more involved in the new ventures that emerged from that conference. The level of investment was around $25,000 to $100,000 in five to 10 startups per year.Calacanis publicly announced in 2018 that he had sold all of his Facebook stock, expressing sharp criticism of company CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on the Too Embarrassed to Ask podcast. He called Zuckerberg \"completely immoral\" in how he runs the business and said, \"No founder should ever sell a company to him.\"Calacanis authored a book titled \"Angel: How to Invest in Technology Startups\u2014Timeless Advice from an Angel Investor Who Turned $100,000 into $100,000,000\" on angel investing published by HarperCollins in 2017.In 2018, Calacanis invested in Calm, a meditation app that is valued at $1 billion.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJason Calacanis, Angel: How to Invest in Technology Startups, Harper Business, 2017 ISBN 9780062560704\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"pageid": 1044721, "ns": 0, "title": "Tony Fadell", "extract": "Anthony Michael Fadell (born March 22, 1969) is an American engineer, inventor, designer, entrepreneur, founder, coach, and active investor.  The \"father of the iPod\", he joined Apple Inc. in 2001, served as the Senior Vice President of the iPod division at Apple Inc. and oversaw all iPod hardware, software, and accessories development and iPhone hardware, firmware, and accessories development from March 2006 to November 2008. He is also a co-inventor of the iPhone, working on the first three generations of the iPhone. In May 2010, he co-founded Nest Labs, which announced its first product, the Nest Learning Thermostat, in October 2011.  Nest was acquired by Google in January 2014 for $3.2B. He resigned from Google in June 2016. Fadell is the Principal at Future Shape, a global investment and advisory firm coaching 200+ startups working on foundational deep technology.\n\n\n== Education and early life ==\nFadell was born to a Lebanese father and a Polish Russian mother. His father was a sales executive at Levi Strauss and Co. Fadell is an alumnus of Grosse Pointe South High School in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. He graduated from the University of Michigan with a BS in Computer Engineering in 1991. While still at University of Michigan, he was CEO of Constructive Instruments, which marketed MediaText, multimedia composition software for children.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter college, Fadell worked for Apple spinoff General Magic for three years, working with Sony, Philips, Matsushita, Toshiba and other consumer electronics firms in the \"General Magic Alliance\" to develop a line of personal handheld communicators. Starting in 1992 as a diagnostics engineer and progressing to a systems architect, he was responsible for the development of a number of technologies and devices, including the Sony Magic Link and Motorola Envoy, both of which were part of the Magic Cap platform.\n\n\n=== Philips Electronics ===\nIn 1995, he was hired by Philips where he co-founded their Mobile Computing Group and served as the Chief Technology Officer, and Director of Engineering. He developed a number of Windows CE-based hand-held services, notably the Philips Velo and Nino PDA. Fadell went on to become a Vice President of Philips Strategy and Ventures where he was in charge of developing Philips' digital audio strategy consisting of technology direction for silicon and software, as well as its investment portfolio and potential business models.In July 1999, Fadell started his own company called Fuse to develop the \"Dell of the Consumer Electronics\". One of the devices he had in mind was a small hard disk-based music player and an online-store-for-music. Fuse failed, however, to find a second round of funding, and Fadell started exploring developing the product at other companies. He first approached RealNetworks in 2000 but left after only six weeks.\n\n\n=== Apple Inc. ===\nFadell started working for Apple in February 2001 as a contractor designing the iPod and planning Apple's audio product strategy. His idea for a small hard disk-based music player and an online-store-for-music had caught Steve Jobs's attention. During that time, he created the concept and initial design of the iPod. He was then hired by Apple to assemble and run its iPod & Special Projects group in April 2001. He was tasked with overseeing the design and production of the iPod and iSight devices. He was promoted to vice president of iPod engineering in 2004 and on October 14, 2005, Apple announced that Fadell would replace the retiring Jon Rubinstein as Senior Vice President of the iPod Division on March 31, 2006. On November 3, 2008, The Wall Street Journal broke the story of Fadell's departure from Apple.\n\n\n=== Nest Labs, Inc. ===\n\nWhile building his energy-efficient home near Lake Tahoe in California, Fadell searched for a thermostat and was frustrated by the limited features, high cost and lack of energy efficiency gains provided by available devices. After he left Apple, he spent time around the world and realized people everywhere were having similar energy saving dilemmas as he was in his Tahoe house. Fadell developed the business plan for Nest while living in Paris. Together with Matt Rogers, a former Apple colleague, he set out to redesign the traditional thermostat. In May 2010, Fadell and Rogers co-founded Nest Labs in Palo Alto, CA. Nest Labs, or Nest, is a company that designs and manufactures a sensor-driven, Wi-Fi-enabled, learning programmable thermostat, now in its third generation.\nFadell announced his resignation from Nest on June 3, 2016.\n\n\n=== Future Shape ===\nFadell is Principal at Future Shape, a global advisory and investment firm coaching engineers and scientists working on foundational deep technology. He has been coaching founders and investing in their startups for the better part of the past decade. With 200+ startups in its portfolio, Future Shape seeks to bring technology out of the lab and into our lives. Fadell and his team at Future Shape coach startups to get the fundamentals right for lasting innovation.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn his 30-plus years of experience in the consumer electronics industry, Fadell has authored more than 300 patents. In 2012, he was the recipient of the Alva Award, honoring him as \"the next great serial inventor\". Vanity Fair also recognized him as a trailblazer on their 2012 Next Establishment list. In 2013, Fadell was acknowledged as one of Business Insider's Top 75 Designers in Technology, Fast Company's 100 Most Creative People, and CNBC's Top 50 Disruptors.

As of June 2017, about 90% of its startup investments were from overseas, with 50% from USA, 25% from Europe, 10% from China and 15% from the rest of the world.\n\n\n== Founding History ==\nFounded in 2011 by Cyril Ebersweiler and Sean O'Sullivan, the roots of the HAX Accelerator program took hold when another accelerator program, CHINA-AXLR8R was born in Dalian, China in 2009. The summer program produced two promising startups that were working on \"disruptive\" hardware. Cyril Ebersweiler recognized that the opportunity to \"accelerate\" hardware startups had arrived, thanks to the gradual opening of Shenzhen's supply chain. The first HAX Accelerator program ran in Shenzhen from March to June 2012.\n\n\n== HAX Seed ==\nHAX Accelerator is currently an accelerator program exclusively focused on hardware development. The development part of the program takes place in Shenzhen, China, close to the supply chain and factory ecosystem available there. In addition to the on-site program, startups receive a $100,000 investment, in exchange for 10% equity.\nOver 111 days, startups focus on improving their product positioning and strategy, iterate on prototypes, prepare for manufacturing, and launch with media and , they manufacture and distribute it. Mentors assist the startups in practical areas of business like executive coaching, graphic design, mechanical and packaging design, factory sourcing, distribution.\nTwice a week, companies share their progress and receive feedback from mentors and peers. At the end of the program the startup presents the final product to investors and raise further capital. HAX Accelerator companies receive up to $200k in matching funds from the SOSV Hardware scaling fund.\n\n\n== HAX Growth ==\nThe HAX Growth program based is San Francisco prepares hardware startups for scaling their distribution, via mentoring and introductions to buyers at global retailers. The Growth program runs twice a year for 8 weeks. There is no cash investment associated. Startups join the program in exchange for 2% equity.\n\n\n== Selection Process ==\nStartups are selected among hundreds of applicants, by applying online with a prototype (HAX Seed) or product (HAX Growth) targeting a large market with a major competitive advantage. This advantage is often derived from software or science.\n\n\n== Notable Startups ==\nAs of June 2017, over 200 startups have participated in the HAX Accelerator programs. Among notable startups are:\n\nMakeblock, a Shenzhen-based STEM robotics company that raised over $36M at a $200M valuation.\nSeveral robotics companies such as Simbe Robotics (inventory robot), Dispatch (delivery robot) and Rovenso (all-terrain rover)\n11 startups who raised over $1M on Kickstarter including CHIP, Kokoon, Prynt and more.\nM5Stack, a Shenzhen-based company making stackable product development toolkits based on ESP32, targeting applications such as STEM Learning and IoT. In 2017, the founder of M5Stack, Jimmy Lai, received a seed round investment from HAX and officially founded M5Stack.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"}, {"pageid": 28195927, "ns": 0, "title": "Macintosh startup", "extract": "The classic Macintosh startup sequence included the startup chime, Happy Mac, Sad Mac, and Chimes of Death. On modern Macs the startup chime is disabled by default, with the exception of the 2017 MacBook Air.\n\n\n== Startup chime ==\nThe Macintosh startup chime is played on power-up, before trying to boot an operating system. The sound indicates that diagnostic tests run immediately at startup have found no hardware or fundamental software problems. The specific sound differs depending on the ROM, which greatly varies depending on Macintosh model. The first sound version in the first three Macintosh models is a simple square-wave \"beep\", and all subsequent sounds are various chords.\nMark Lentczner created the code for the arpeggiated chord used on the Macintosh II. Variations of this sound were used until Jim Reekes created the startup chime used for the Quadra 700 through the Quadra 800. Reekes said, \"The startup sound was done in my home studio on a Korg Wavestation EX. It's a C major chord, played with both hands stretched out as wide as possible (with 3rd at the top, if I recall).\" He created the sound as he was annoyed with the tri-tone startup chimes as he felt they were too associated with the death chimes and the computer crashes. He recalls that Apple did not give him permission to change the sound but that he secretly snuck the sound into the computers with the help of engineers who were in charge of the ROM chips. When Apple discovered this, he refused to change it, using various claims in order to keep the new sound intact. He was also the creator of the iconic (or \"earconic\", as he calls it) \"bong\" startup chime used in most Macintoshes since the Quadra 840AV. A slightly lower-pitched version of this chime was used on all PCI-based Power Macs until the iMac G3. The Macintosh LC, LC II, and Macintosh Classic II do not use the Reekes chime, instead using an F major chord that just produces a \"ding\" sound. The first generation of Power Macintosh computers also do not use the Reekes chime, instead using a chord strummed on a Yamaha 12-string acoustic guitar by jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan. Further, the Power Macintosh 5200\u20136300 computers (excluding the 5400 and 5500, which have the \"bong\" chime like the one used for the PCI-based Power Macs) use a unique chime, which was also used for the television commercials for the Power Macintosh and PowerBook series from 1995 until 1998, and the 20th Anniversary Macintosh uses another unique sound.\nFor models built prior to the introduction of the Power Macintosh in 1994, a Sad Mac icon, an error code, and distinctive sounds, are displayed on failure of initial self-diagnostic tests. This phenomenon is referred to as the \"Chimes of Death\".\nThe chime for all Mac computers from 1998-2016 is the same chime used first in the iMac G3. The chord is a F-sharp major chord, and was produced by pitch-shifting the 840AV's sound. The Mac startup chime is now a registered trademark in the United States, and is featured in the 2008 film WALL-E when the titular robot character is fully recharged by solar panels as well as in the 2007 Brad Paisley song \"Online\".\"As of 2016, Apple has disabled the startup chime by default starting with the late 2016 MacBook Pro. Apple has since updated its support documentation to reflect this change, removing references to the startup chime from the NVRAM reset instructions for this model. However, it is still possible to re-enable the startup chime using a terminal command to edit an NVRAM value.\n\n\n== Happy Mac ==\n\nA Happy Mac is the normal bootup (startup) icon of an Apple Macintosh computer running older versions of the Mac operating system. It was designed by Susan Kare in the 1980s, drawing inspiration from the design of the Compact Macintosh series and from the Batman character Two-Face.  The icon remained unchanged until the introduction of New World ROM Macs, when it was updated to 8-bit color. The Happy Mac indicates that booting has successfully begun, whereas a Sad Mac (along with the \"Chimes of Death\" melody or one or more beeps) indicates a hardware problem.\nWhen a Macintosh boots into the classic Mac OS (Mac OS 9 or lower), the system will play its startup chime, the screen will turn gray, and the Happy Mac icon will appear, followed by the Mac OS splash screen (or the small \"Welcome to Macintosh\" screen in System 7.5 and earlier), which underwent several stylistic changes. Mac OS versions 8.6 and later also includes the version number in this splash screen (for example, \"Welcome to Mac OS 8.6\").\nOn early Macs that had no internal hard drive, the computer boots up to a point where it needs to load the operating system from a floppy disk. Until the user inserts the correct disk, the Mac displays a floppy icon with a blinking question mark. In later Macs, a folder icon with a question mark that repeatedly changes to the Finder icon is shown if a System Folder or boot loader file cannot be found on the startup disk.\nWith the introduction of Mac OS X, in addition to the blinking system folder icon, a prohibition icon was added to show an incorrect OS version is found. The bomb screen in the classic Mac OS was replaced with a kernel panic, which was originally colored white but was changed to black in version 10.3. With Mac OS X 10.1, a new Happy Mac was included. This is also the last version that had a Happy Mac icon; in version 10.2, the Happy Mac symbol was replaced with the Apple logo.\nThe Face ID logo for the iPhone X was based off the Happy Mac.\n\n\n== Sad Mac ==\n\nA Sad Mac is a symbol used by older-generation Apple Macintosh computers (hardware using the Old World ROM and not Open Firmware, which are those predating onboard USB), starting with the original 128K Macintosh and ending with the last NuBus-based Power Macintosh models (including the first-generation 6100, 7100, 8100, as well as the PowerBook 5300 and 1400), to indicate a severe hardware or software problem that prevented startup from occurring successfully. The Sad Mac icon is displayed, along with a set of hexadecimal codes that indicate the type of problem at startup. Different codes are for different errors.  This is used in place of the normal Happy Mac icon, which indicates that the startup-time hardware tests were successful. In 68k models made after the Macintosh II, the Chimes of Death are played.\nModels prior to the Macintosh II crash silently and display the Sad Mac, without playing any tone. PowerPC Macs play a sound effect of a car crash, and computers equipped with the PowerPC upgrade card use the three note brass fanfare death chime (A, E-natural, and E-flat), followed by the sound of a drum, same as the Macintosh Performa 6200 and Macintosh Performa 6300.\nA Sad Mac may be deliberately generated at startup by pressing the interrupt switch on Macintosh computers that had one installed, or by pressing Command and Power keys shortly after the startup chime. On some Macintoshes such as PowerBook 540c, if the user presses the command and power keys before the boot screen displays, it will play the \"chimes of death\". The chimes are a fraction of normal speed and there is no Sad Mac displayed.\nOld World ROM Power Macintosh and PowerBook models based on the PCI architecture do not use a Sad Mac icon and will instead only play the error/car-crash sound on a hardware failure (such as missing or bad memory, unusable CPU, or similar).\nMac OS X 10.2 Jaguar and later instead use the Universal \"no\" symbol to denote a hardware or software error that renders the computer non-bootable.\n\n\n=== Sad iPod ===\n\nOn the iPod, if damage or an error occurs in the hardware or the firmware, for example, if its files are deleted, a Sad iPod appears. This is similar to the Sad Mac, but instead of a Macintosh, there is an iPod, and there are no chimes of death. The icon also lacks a nose, and the frown is flipped horizontally. It also does not show hexadecimal codes indicating what problem occurred in the iPod. This error screen will not show up when a problem occurs in the newer iPods.\n\n\n== Chimes of Death ==\nThe Chimes of Death are the Macintosh equivalent of a beep code on IBM PC compatibles. On all Macintosh models predating the adoption of PCI and Open Firmware, the Chimes of Death are often accompanied by a Sad Mac icon in the middle of the screen.\nDifferent Macintosh series used different death chimes. The Macintosh II was the first to use the death chimes (a loud and eerie upward major arpeggio, with different chimes on many models). The Macintosh Quadra, Centris, Performa, LC and the Macintosh Classic played a generally softer and lower pitched version of the upward major arpeggio, followed by three or four notes, with slight variation depending on the model of the Macintosh. The PowerBook 5300, 190, and 1400 used the second half of the 8-note arpeggio as found on the Quadra and Centris models, or the entire death chime if the error occurred before the screen lights up. The Macintosh Quadra AV660 and Centris AV660 used a sound of a single pass of Roland D-50's \"Digital Native Dance\" sample loop, while the NuBus based Power Macintosh models (including 6100, 7100, and 8100) series used a car crash sound. The Power Macintosh and Performa 6200 and 6300 series, along with the Power Macintosh upgrade card, used an eerily dramatic 3-note brass fanfare with a rhythm of drums and cymbals. The pre-G3 PCI Power Macs, the beige G3 Power Macs, the G3 All-In-One, and the PowerBook 2400, 3400 and G3 all used a sound of glass shattering; these models did not display a Sad Mac icon. Since the introduction of the iMac in 1998, the Chimes of Death are no longer used and were replaced with a series of tones to indicate hardware errors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBooting\nPower-on self-test\nScreens of Death\nFloppy Disk\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Original Macintosh: Boot Beep \u2013 Folklore.org"}, {"pageid": 1666533, "ns": 0, "title": "Y Combinator", "extract": "Y Combinator is an American seed accelerator launched in March 2005 and has been used to launch over 2,000 companies including Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise Automation, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, and Dropbox. The combined valuation of the top YC companies was over $155 billion as of October, 2019.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nY Combinator was founded in 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Trevor Blackwell and Robert Tappan Morris.From 2005 to 2008, one program was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and one was held in Mountain View, California. As Y Combinator grew to 40 investments per year, running two programs became too much. In January 2009, Y Combinator announced that the Cambridge program would be closed and all future programs would take place in Silicon Valley.In 2009, Sequoia Capital led the $2 million investment round into an entity of Y Combinator to enable them to invest in approximately 60 companies a year. The following year, Sequoia led a $8.25 million funding round for Y Combinator to further increase the number of startups the company could fund.Then, in 2011, Yuri Milner and SV Angel offered every Y Combinator company a $150,000 convertible note investment. The amount put into each company was changed to $80,000 when Start Fund was renewed.In September 2013, Paul Graham announced Y Combinator would fund nonprofit organizations that were accepted into the program after having tested the concept with Watsi (while continuing to fund mostly for-profit startups).In 2014, founder Paul Graham announced he was stepping down and that Sam Altman would take over as president of Y Combinator. That same year, Altman announced \"The New Deal\" for YC startups, which offers $120,000 for 7% equity.Late in 2014, Sam Altman announced a partnership with Transcriptic to provide increased support for Y Combinator's growing community of biotech companies. Then in 2015, he announced a partnership with Bolt and increased support for hardware companies.The YC Fellowship Program was announced in July 2015, with the goal of funding companies at the idea or prototype stage. The first batch of YC Fellowship included 32 companies that received an equity-free grant instead of an investment.In January 2016, Y Combinator announced version 2 of the Fellowship program, with participating companies receiving $20k investment for a 1.5% equity stake. The equity stake is structured as a convertible security that only converts into shares if a company has an IPO, or a funding event or acquisition that values the company at $100m or more. The YC Fellowship was short-lived. In September 2016, then CEO Sam Altman announced that the fellowship will be discontinued.On 11 August 2016, YC announced that YC partners would visit 11 countries to meet with founders and learn more about how they could be helpful to international startup communities. Those 11 countries were Nigeria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, Germany, Russia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Israel, and India.In September 2016, Y Combinator announced that then CEO Altman would be leaving Y Combinator and moving the role of president of YC Group, which includes Y Combinator. Former Twitter chief financial officer and chief operating officer Ali Rowghani was then in charge of the YC Continuity Fund when it started and continues to act as CEO of YC Continuity. Michael Seibel, who co-founded Justin.tv, is the new CEO of YC Core, the program that Paul Buchheit has run since 2016.In 2017, Y Combinator announced Startup School, an online course that released public videos and also coached individual startups on a larger scale to replace the fellowship. 1584 startups graduated the program in its first year.In 2018, Y Combinator announced a new batch of startup school. After a software glitch, all 15,000 startups that applied to the program were accepted, only to learn a few hours later that they had been rejected.On 20 May 2019, Sam Altman announced he was stepping down and that Geoff Ralston would take over as President of Y Combinator.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nY Combinator interviews and selects two or more batches of companies per year. The companies receive seed money, advice, and connections in exchange for 7% equity of the company. The program includes \"office hours\", where startup founders meet individually and group meetings. Founders also participate in weekly dinners where guests from the Silicon Valley ecosystem (successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, etc.) speak to the founders.\nY Combinator\u2019s motto is \"Make Something People Want.\" The program teaches founders to market their product, team and market, refining their business model, achieving product/market fit, and scaling the startup into a high growth business, etc. The program ends with Demo Day, where startups present their business and sometimes technology to potential investors.Y Combinator has introduced additional programs since 2015, including:\n\nIn July 2015, Y Combinator introduced the YC Fellowship Program aimed at companies at an earlier stage than the main program.\nIn October 2015, Y Combinator introduced the YC Continuity Fund. The fund allows Y Combinator to make pro rata investments in their alumni companies with valuations under $300 million. Y Combinator will also consider leading or participating in later stage growth financing rounds for YC companies.\nNonprofit research lab YC Research was announced in October 2015. Researchers are paid as full-time employees and can receive equity in Y Combinator. OpenAI was the first project undertaken by YC Research, and in January 2016 a second study on basic income was also announced. Another project is research on new cities. Australian quantum physicist Michael Nielsen is a research fellow at YC Research since 2017.\nIn October 2015, YC introduced YC Research to fund long-term fundamental research. YC President Sam Altman donated $10m.\nDuring 2017-2019, YC launched Startup School, the Series A program, the YC Growth program, Work at a Startup, and YC China.\nIn March 2019, it was reported that Y Combinator was moving headquarters to San Francisco.As of late 2019, Y Combinator had invested in >2,000 companies, most of which are for-profit. Non-profit organizations can also participate in the main YC program. Few non-profits have been accepted in the last years, among them Watsi, Women Who Code, New Story (charity), SIRUM (organization), Zidisha, 80,000 Hours, and Our World in Data.\n\n\n== People ==\nY Combinator was founded in March 2005 by Paul Graham, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell.\nIn 2010, Kirsty Nathoo joined as an accountant and became CFO in 2012.In early 2010, Harj Taggar joined as an advisor.

KSUM was primarily founded to undertake the planning, establishment, and management of the Technology Business Incubator (TBI), a startup accelerator in Kerala, to promote technology-based entrepreneurship activities, and to create the infrastructure and environment required to support high-technology-based businesses. \nAdditional goals of KSUM include: \n\ncoordinating the functions of other incubators in the state\nstrengthening the entrepreneurship development activities of the state government\npromoting knowledge-driven and technology-based startup ventures by students, faculties, and local entrepreneurs\nplanning and implementing linkages with industry and networking activities\nsetting up Research and Development facilities\nencouraging the formation of Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cells (IEDCs) and technoparks in academic institutions, and capacity building programmes for human resources.\n\n\n== Incubation programme ==\nKSUM supports entrepreneurs in developing technology-based business ventures, for example startups with high-technology products. A startup's early development can usually be divided into three stages, pre-incubation (3-6 months), incubation (6-12 months) and an accelerator stage (3-6 months).The pre-incubation stage mainly focuses on ideation of a potentially innovative idea.  \nDuring the incubation stage, startup companies begin product development and prepare themselves for marketing. KSUM provides the startups with modular space, any applicable grants or funding, and mentorship. They also provide services such as entrepreneur training and workshops. \nIn the accelerator stage KSUM offers a business tool box and a business advisory service, resembling traditional management consulting or mentoring. KSUM will assist the startup in presentations to venture capitalists and investors.\n\n\n== KSUM - EY Accelerator ==\nKSUM has collaborated with Ernst & Young to develop a Business & Technology Accelerator providing fully equipped and functional office space of 1500 sq.ft at the KINFRA Film & Video Park, Thiruvananthapuram. The objective is to offer technology and business leadership and mentorship support for selected start-ups incubated in the state of Kerala. Start-ups are offered a six-month acceleration programme (extendable to 12 months) to increase the business sophistication and skills of selected entrepreneurs.

A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention which aims to provide a stimulus for local entrepreneurship and serves as a platform for learning and innovation. It is a small scale workshop offering digital fabrication that empowers the users to create smart devices which can be tailored to local or personal needs. \nThe Fab Lab is also a way for local entrepreneurs to connect to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers and innovators. The entrepreneur thus becomes part of a self-sustaining global knowledge-sharing network. The Fab Lab programme aims to encourage startups in printed electronics and other such fields in Kerala. This project is a collaboration between KSUM and the Center for Bits and Atoms Fab Lab Foundation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n== Other Programmes ==\n\n\n=== Learn To Code (Raspberry Pi Program) ===\nThe Kerala government launched the initiative \"Learn to Code\" in 2015.
